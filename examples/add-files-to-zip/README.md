IronZIP provides the functionality to edit an existing ZIP file. Start by employing the `FromFile` method to load the archive that requires modification. Once the archive is loaded, the `Add` method can be utilized to insert additional files into the archive. To finalize changes, the `SaveAs` method allows you to save the updated ZIP file.

This capability makes it straightforward to adapt and enhance your ZIP archives in line with the evolving needs of your project. IronZIP streamlines the process of managing archives in your C# applications.
