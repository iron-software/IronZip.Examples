IronZIP provides features that allow users to alter an already existing ZIP archive. Start by utilizing the `FromFile` method to open the ZIP file you wish to edit. Once the archive is open, you can employ the `Add` method to append new files to it. Finally, save the updated version of the ZIP file using the `SaveAs` method.

This functionality facilitates the seamless updating and enlargement of ZIP archives to meet the evolving needs of your projects. IronZIP streamlines the management of archives within your C# applications.
