The ZIP format is a method of file compression and archiving that helps decrease the size of files, making them easier and more efficient to store and send. It encapsulates multiple files and folders into a single archive file, typically labeled with a `.zip` extension. This format is commonly utilized for backing up data, distributing software, and sharing files.

To construct a ZIP file, begin by employing a `using` statement to create an instance of a ZIP object. Within this `using` block, you should call the `Add` method to include files in the ZIP archive. The path provided to the `Add` method can specify a directory, resulting in all files contained in that directory being included in the archive. Finally, utilize the `SaveAs` method to finalize and save the ZIP file.
