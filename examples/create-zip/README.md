ZIP is a widely adopted format for file compression and archiving, which helps in decreasing the size of files for more effective storage and data transfer. This format encapsulates multiple files and folders into one single file, typically denoted with a `.zip` extension. ZIP files are extensively utilized for archiving data, distributing software, and sharing files.

To create a ZIP archive, utilize the `using` statement to create an instance of a ZIP object. Within the `using` block, employ the `Add` method to incorporate files into the ZIP archive. You can specify a directory as the entry file path, and all files within that directory will be included in the archive. Finally, use the `SaveAs` method to output the ZIP file.
