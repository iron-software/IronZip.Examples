ZIP is a widely used format for compressing and archiving files, which minimizes file size for more effective storage and transfer. It amalgamates various files and folders into one consolidated archive, typically identified by a '.zip' extension. ZIP files are frequently employed for backing up data, distributing software, and sharing files.

For the purpose of decompressing files from a ZIP archive, the method `ExtractArchiveToDirectory` can be used. This involves indicating the ZIP file's path and the destination directory where the files should be extracted.
