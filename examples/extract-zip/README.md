The ZIP format is widely recognized for its efficiency in compressing and archiving files. By consolidating several files and directories into one archive, typically denoted by a '.zip' extension, it facilitates more streamlined storage and transfer. This format is particularly useful for backing up data, distributing software, and sharing files.

To decompress the contents of a ZIP archive, the `ExtractArchiveToDirectory` method can be employed. This function requires you to define the path of the ZIP file and the destination directory where the files will be extracted.
