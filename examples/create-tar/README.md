TAR, which stands for '*T*ape *Ar*chive,' is a widely used archiving format and tool in Unix and Linux environments. It aggregates several files and directories into one single file, maintaining the original file structure and metadata, but does not compress them. To achieve compression, TAR is usually paired with tools like gzip or bzip2, making it a popular choice for backing up data and distributing software.

To begin creating a TAR file, initiate an **IronTarArchive** object. With the `Add` method, you can incorporate multiple files into your TAR archive. This function is capable of processing an entire directory by including every file within that directory in the archive. Conclude the process by calling the `SaveAs` method to generate and store the TAR file.
