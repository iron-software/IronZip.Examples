To work with a ZIP file that is secured by a password, it's necessary to unlock, extract, or manage the data within the ZIP file by using the correct password. This enables decryption of the ZIP file, allowing one to view, extract, or alter the contents.

When using IronZIP to handle a password-protected ZIP archive, you must provide the password as the second argument while supplying the ZIP file's path to the constructor. With this setup, you can browse the files within the archive or include additional files to the archive, then create and export a new ZIP file.
