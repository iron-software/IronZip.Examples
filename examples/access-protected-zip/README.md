Working with a ZIP archive that is safeguarded by a password requires you to decrypt the ZIP by supplying the proper password. This is essential to view, extract, or alter the contents housed within the encrypted ZIP file.

When you use IronZIP to manage a password-protected ZIP archive, you'll begin by providing the password as the second argument when you instantiate a new ZIP file object with its path. This allows you to access the contents, add additional files to the archive, and eventually produce a new ZIP file containing your updates.
