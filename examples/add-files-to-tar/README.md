The following example illustrates how to manipulate an existing TAR archive and generate a new TAR file using IronZip.

IronZip provides the functionality to edit TAR files, which is highly beneficial for archive management within C# projects. Begin by using the `FromFile` method to gain access to the archive you want to edit.

After accessing the archive, the `Add` method allows you to insert new files into the archive. This functionality is crucial for efficiently updating and enlarging your zip archives to accommodate the changing requirements of your projects.

To conclude, apply the `SaveAs` method to create the new modified TAR file.
