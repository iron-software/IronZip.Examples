TAR files are commonly employed alongside GZIP and BZIP2 due to their effective compression features. Standalone, TAR acts merely as an archiving tool without any built-in compression functions.

For extracting files from a TAR archive, the `IronTarArchive` class provides the `ExtractArchiveToDirectory` method.
